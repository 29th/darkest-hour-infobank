Changing your 'prone' key from

**`Prone`**

to

**`Button``   ``bSprint``   ``|``   ``Prone`**

will allow you to both use the faster 'dive' animation and climb up onto
objects while walking. You can easily do it by typing this in the
console:

`set input {key} Button bSprint | Prone`

Want to know what a particular key is bound to? Type this in your
console:

`get input {key}`
