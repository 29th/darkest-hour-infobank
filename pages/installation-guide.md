## Prerequisites

  - Ensure [Red Orchestra](Red_Orchestra "wikilink") is installed.
  - Download [Darkest
    Hour](http://forums.darkesthourgame.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=4118)
    from one of the links listed.

## Installation

Simply run through *DarkestHour\_PublicBeta2\_Full.exe* and it will
automatically install Darkest Hour to the proper directory.

When you're finished, there should be a folder inside your [*Red
Orchestra*](GamePaths "wikilink") directory called *DarkestHour*. Simply
restart Steam and it will show up on your Games list.

## Maps

If you want to download all of the current DH maps (except our private
ones) at one shot, you can use [this
torrent](http://www.gameupdates.org/details.php?id=2866) if you already
have a bit torrent client. If you don't, you can use [this
program](http://29th.org/uploads/olson/bt-Darkest_Hour_Map_Pack_20080924.exe)([VT](http://www.virustotal.com/analisis/4af7b09d600164483a062886763d9b39)),
which includes a simple, automatic client along with the torrent.
