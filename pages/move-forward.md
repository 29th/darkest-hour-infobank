Those who thrive for realism and adrenaline-pumping gaming have
discovered the newest and most realistic World War II game on the net.
Darkest Hour: Normandy 1944 simulates as many aspects of the war as
technically possible and provides a growing foundation for the many
players, realism units and clans that have *moved forward* and joined
the battle.

## What is Darkest Hour?

Darkest Hour: Normandy 1944 is a *first-person shooter* with a World War
II theme, involving realistic battles between the US/UK and German
armies. It was created as a modification for [Red Orchestra:
Ostfront 41-45](http://redorchestragame.com), which is a similar game
between the Soviet and German armies. Both games were built on the
[Unreal 2004
Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament_2004), allowing
for possibilities never before reached by World War II games.

## Features

### Realistic Infantry Combat

## What's So Different?

### Crosshairs Are For Arcade Games

Darkest Hour strives to provide as realistic an experience as possible.
Unlike most *first-person shooters,* there is no bright-red crosshair on
Darkest Hour - players must aim like they would a real weapon, by using
the sights on the top, or by pointing it in the correct direction and
hoping for a hit.

### Maps That Keep Going

Unlike most *first-person shooters,* Darkest Hour is not bound by range
in its levels. While you may be used to closely-aligned urban fighting,
this engine allows for massive **200 square kilometre** terrains with
multiple villages, fields, farms or forests.

### Tired of Walking?

Walking 200 km can get tiring, so Darkest Hour has vehicles to make up
for it. From pick-up trucks to Armoured Personnel Carriers to Tiger
Tanks and Shermans, DH has it all. Vehicles can serve to transport
soldiers to the battle or as weapons, themselves, supporting
multiple-person crews and realistic **tank warfare.**

### 64 Player Servers

The engine can support up to 64 players on a server, and there are
several popular 50 slot servers that perform seamlessly. Picture
storming Omaha beach with 31 other players next to you being fired upon
by 32 on the other team.

### Real Ballistics

Whether your firing the MG from your halftrack at the enemy squad across
the field or firing your rifle into the nearby window, ballistics affect
your accuracy. The further the round travels, the more drop it will have
from gravity, and you will have to accommodate for the time it takes the
round to get there if the enemy is moving. Watch out for ricochets\!
