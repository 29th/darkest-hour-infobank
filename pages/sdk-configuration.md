First, [install the *RedOrchestra SDK
Beta*](Installing_the_SDK "wikilink"), found in your Steam *Games*
window under *Tools*. By default, this program allows you to modify
*[Red Orchestra](Red_Orchestra "wikilink")*. To set up your SDK to
modify *Darkest Hour* instead,

1.  Right-Click *RedOrchestra SDK Beta* on your Steam *Games* window
    under *Tools* and select *Properties*
2.  Click the *Set launch options...* button on the new window
3.  Type the following in the text line and press *OK*:

`-mod="darkesthour"`

After this is done, you will be able to run this tool configured for
Darkest Hour. If you would like confirmation of the change, browse the
drop down text box in the *Textures* window after the program starts up
and you will see terms like *DH* and *British*, etc.
