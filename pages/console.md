The console is where commands can be entered while the game is loaded,
ranging from client commands to server commands. The default key used to
open your console is the \[\`\] key, located to the left of the \[1\] on
the number row in the top left of your keyboard. You can then enter your
command and press the \[Enter\] key, then press the \[\`\] key again to
close the console.
