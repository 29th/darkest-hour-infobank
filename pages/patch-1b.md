On Sunday, 22 June 2008, the Darkest Hour development team released
*DarkestHour Beta 1b*, a patch that fixed the bug created by the Red
Orchestra team that prevented Darkest Hour users from accessing the
*Internet* tab in the *Multiplayer* window, as well as a few others.

## Installation Guide

read the original [Installation Guide](Installation_Guide "wikilink").

    Upgrade](http://www.moddb.com/mods/darkest-hour-normandy-1944/downloads/darkest-hour-upgrade-from-v10a-to-v10b)
  - **If you *didn't* already install [Patch 1a](Patch_1a "wikilink")**,

    Upgrade](http://www.moddb.com/mods/darkest-hour-normandy-1944/downloads/darkest-hour-upgrade-from-v10-to-v10b)

## Bug Fixes

  - Fixed *Internet* button not lighting up on the *Multiplayer* screen
  - Fixed Russian red star incorrectly displaying instead of instead US
    white star on *Last Objective* messages
  - G15 LCD screen now reads *Darkest Hour Normandy 1944* instead of
    *Red Orchestra Ostfront 41-45*
  - Allied capture bar colour is now blue rather than red, to prevent
    confusion now that Axis are red team
