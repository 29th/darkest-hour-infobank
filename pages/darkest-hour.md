***Darkest Hour: Normandy 1944*** is a
[tactical](tactical_shooter "wikilink") [first person
shooter](first_person_shooter "wikilink") created as a [standalone
modification](Mod_\(computer_gaming\) "wikilink") for *[Red Orchestra:
Ostfront 41-45](Red_Orchestra:_Ostfront_41-45 "wikilink")*. Its theme is
the European theatre of the Second World War, beginning on
[D-Day](D-Day "wikilink") in [Normandy, France](Normandy "wikilink").

## Development and Release

*Darkest Hour* was created in November of 2006 by *Darklight Games,* a
development team dedicated to providing a realistic experience through
streamlined game play principles and a strong team dynamic. Its
projected release date was Quarter 2 of 2008, and sure enough, on
[D-Day](D-Day "wikilink") 2008 a beta version of *Darkest Hour: Normandy
1944* was released.

The development team behind *Darkest Hour* is actively improving the
game based on their original goals and, even more so, community input.
While it already has a dedicated community base, *Darkest Hour* is far
from completed. *Darklight Games* has many plans in store adding more
vehicles, maps and features to make the game as realistic and enjoyable
as possible.

## How to Get Darkest Hour

*Darkest Hour*'s only prerequisite is [Red Orchestra: Ostfront
41-45](Red_Orchestra:_Ostfront_41-45 "wikilink"), which is available
through
[Steam](http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=app&AppId=1200).
With that installed, *Darkest Hour* can be downloaded and installed from
its [ModDB
