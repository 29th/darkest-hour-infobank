This page contains several tweaks to increase the in-game performance of
Darkest Hour. They are not necessarily dependent on each other and can
be tried individually or all at once. More performance increases can be
found in the [Unofficial Tweak
Guide](Unofficial_Tweak_Guide "wikilink").

## More Accurate Aiming

To make aiming with the mouse more accurate and more like Day of Defeat,

1.  Go to *Configuration* in the Main Menu
2.  Click the *Input* section at the top
3.  Uncheck *Mouse Smoothing*
4.  Uncheck *Reduce Mouse Lag*

## Turn Off CPU Suckers

There are a few features of this engine that make the game look great
but can cause performance issues on lower-end computers. Disabling these
should improve your performance, without having a major aesthetic
impact.

1.  Go to *Configuration* in the Main Menu
2.  Click the *Display* section at the top
3.  Check the box next to *Show Advanced Options* to enable the options
    on the right half of the screen
    1.  Uncheck *Motion Blur*
    2.  Uncheck *HDR Bloom*
    3.  Uncheck *Dynamic Lighting*

## Lower Game Details

If you are getting low FPS and find it difficult to play, try lowering
the overall detail of your video.

1.  Go to *Configuration* in the Main Menu
2.  Click the *Display* section at the top
3.  Select the drop-down box next to *Game details* and choose a lower
    setting

If there are still performance issues, try turning the setting to
"Lowest"

## Change DirectX Version

This is a very common problem. If your game runs unusually slow or there
are very odd visual defects in game, your video card may not be
supporting DirectX 9.0 properly. Simply changing the version of DirectX
used by Darkest Hour should fix this.

1.  Go to *Configuration* in the Main Menu
2.  Click the *Display* section at the top
3.  Select the drop-down box next to *Render Device* and choose "Direct
    3D" **instead of** "Direct 3D 9.0"

## Turn Off VSync

Your video card may have a feature called VSync enabled by default,
which helps make movement more realistic and less like a "computer
game". This, however, requires a decent amount of processing power and
disabling it can improve your FPS a great deal.

Disabling VSync is not done inside Darkest Hour, but in your video
card's control panel. To find this, go to *Start \> Control Panel* and
look for *Display Settings* or a section with your video card's brand
name on it (such as *NVIDIA Control Panel*). Browse around for a section
on VSync and disable it. If you are having trouble finding this, ask for
help in the [Medical
Office](http://www.29th.org/forums/index.php?board=28.0).

## Change Audio Settings

If you have a physical soundcard that isn't onboard/integrated, this fix
will take some of the load off the CPU.

1.  Go to *Configuration* in the Main Menu
2.  Click the *Audio* section at the top
3.  Select the drop-down box next to *Audio Mode* and choose "H/W 3D
    Audio" **instead of** "3D Audio"

In addition, you can check the box next to *Low Sound Detail* to further
help performance, but only do this if necessary as the audio is arguably
one of the best parts of the game.

## Change Your Resolution

Increasing your game resolution will provide a sharper, larger and more
detailed image. Decreasing it will do the opposite. A lower resolution
is less demanding and can provide better performance, but looks less
attractive visually. To change your resolution:

1.  Go to *Configuration* in the Main Menu
2.  Click the *Display* section at the top
3.  Select the drop-down box next to Game details and choose your
    desired resolution

## Run in a Window

Running the game in a window reduces the risk of crashing but can have
an negative effect on FPS. To switch between fullscreen and a window,
hold your \[Alt\] key and press the \[Enter\] key. You can switch
between these modes at any time during the game. If the window is too
small, [change your resolution](#Change_Your_Resolution "wikilink").

## Reconfigure Your Controls

Red Orchestra and Darkest Hour use controls that vary from Day of Defeat
in several ways. For example, \[Q\] and \[E\] are used for leaning, and
crouching is a toggle. By going to *Configuration* in the Main Menu and
selecting the *Controls* section at the top, you can change your control
setup. A few recommended (but entirely optional) changes are:

  - Set *Crouch* to \[CTRL\]. Note the difference between *Crouch* and
    *Toggle Crouch* being that *Toggle Crouch* requires you to tap the
    key again to stand up, whereas *Crouch* simply stands up when you
    let go of the key.
  - Set *Prone* to \[Z\] like in Day of Defeat
  - Set *Use* to \[F\] as \[E\] is taken and \[F\] is closeby
      - If you do this, you will have to set *Attach Bayonet/Deploy MG*
        to an alternative (such as \[C\]) in the *Weapons* section
        below.
  - In the *Communication* section, you may want to change *Say* to
    \[Y\] like in Day of Defeat, and *Team Say* to \[U\].
  - Your microphone button choice is up to you, but it is in the
    *Communication* section as well, and bound to *Scroll Lock* by
    default, which is far out of reach. I personally use \[CAPS LOCK\].
      - The Public/Local/Team channel switch binds are a way of
        switching between "all talk", "team talk" and "vehicle talk"

## TweakGuides.com

If you still have trouble with performance or simply want to max out
your computer's potential in Darkest Hour, read TweakGuide.com's [UT2004
Guide](http://www.tweakguides.com/UT2004_1.html). It is for Unreal
Tournament 2004, but Darkest Hour runs on that engine so the tweaks will
work just the same. The guide even includes a program that can assist
you in your tweaking.
