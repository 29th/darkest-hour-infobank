Darkest Hour contains voice commands, known as *Taunts*, that threaten
and insult the enemy. Some of these *Taunts* contain strong profanity,
and for those of our members with young ones in the background, there is
a way to disable this profanity.

1.  Go to *Configuration* in the Main Menu
2.  Click the *Audio* section at the top
3.  Select the drop-down box next to *Play Voice Messages* and choose
    "No taunts"

Doing this will allow all voice messages to play except the taunts,
which contain profanity.
