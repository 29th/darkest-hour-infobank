## Longer Name

To have a longer name (maximum 32 characters), type in
[console](console "wikilink"):  
setname Look\_at\_my\_long\_name (No quotation " are marks necessary,
even if using spaces)

## Spaces In Name

To have spaces in your name, use the below ALT combination. To do this,
hold the ALT key while pressing the sequence of numbers listed below.
The numbers must be pressed on the NUMPAD on the right of the keyboard
and not the number row at the top of the keyboard. Doing this ALT
combination will create a space character where you are typing.

`ALT + 0160`

#### Laptop Keyboards

If you have a laptop keyboard that does not have a number pad on the
side, you can still add spaces to your name. Your number pad is actually
built in to the other keys on your keyboard and can be accessed using
the *Function* \[Fn\] key, located near the left \[Windows\] key. Notice
the right side of the keyboard's letters such as UIO, JKL, and M which
contain numbers written on them as well - this is your "numpad." Simply
follow the directions above using this as your numpad, while holding
both \[Alt\] and \[Fn\].

If you can't enter it using your laptop keyboard, temporarily plug in a
USB regular keyboard/keypad.
