Binding In-Game is very easy. The syntax for binding from the
[console](console "wikilink") is:

`set input `<key>` `<command>

For example:

`set input F1 say *Salute*`

Then, pressing your \[F1\] key at any time in-game will make you say
\*Salute\* in chat.

For more advanced binds such as combinations of commands, or *OnRelease*
commands, see the [Advanced Binding
Guide](Advanced_Binding_Guide "wikilink").
