ROID is short for *Red Orchestra ID*, and is a 17-18 digit number that
is unique to your steam account.

## Get Your ROID From the Console

While you are in a server, you can [open your
console](Console "wikilink") and type the following command:

`listplayers`

It will display a list of the players in the server, as well as their
ROIDs. You can use your mouse scroll to go up and down the list. The
ROID will be listed next to your name, as shown in the example below.

## Get Your ROID From the Steam Community

Alternatively, you can get an ROID from any Steam Community Profile
page. The **Add to your friends list** link contains the person's ROID
in its URL. Simply right-click it and click 'Copy Link Address' or 'Copy
URL', then paste it somewhere and you have the ROID.

For example, copy the **Add to your friends list** link from [this Steam
Community Profile](http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainwilson/) and
paste it in notepad to get:

<steam://friends/add/76561197961136828>

As you can see, that person's ROID is 76561197961136828
