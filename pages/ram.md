RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It stores data that your computer
is currently using so that it can be accessed quicker. Needless to say,
the more RAM that is installed in your computer, the faster your
computer can run.

To find out how much RAM your computer has installed, hold your
\[Windows\] key and press \[Pause\].
