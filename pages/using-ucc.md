To use **ucc**, you must open command prompt and browse to your [Red
Orchestra System Directory](Game_Paths "wikilink"). This can get very
tedious, however, as changing directories is a pain within command
prompt. It is easier to simply make a short cut that "Starts In" this
directory.

1.  Go to your Desktop and right-click anywhere. Select *New \>
    Shortcut*.
2.  When it asks you for the location of the item, browse to
    *C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe*
3.  Name it whatever you like, such as "ucc"
4.  Right-click your new shortcut and go to *Properties*
5.  In the *Start In* textbox, enter your [Red Orchestra System
    Directory](Game_Paths "wikilink") and click OK

To test this shortcut, open it and type *ucc* It should say *UnrealOS
execution environment, use "ucc help" for help*, etc. If not, see
troubleshooting below.

`NOTE: `**`ucc`**` requires that `*`Steam.dll`*` be present to function.`  
`You will have to browse to your Steam directory and copy-and-paste `*`Steam.dll`*` into `  
`your `[`Red``   ``Orchestra``   ``System`` 
 ``Directory`](Game_Paths "wikilink")` before proceeding.`
