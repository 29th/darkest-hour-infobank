The Red Orchestra SDK (also known as RO Editor/ROEd/UnrealEd) is a
utility used for creating levels, meshes, static meshes, and various
other elements of the game. In addition, it decompiles the Red Orchestra
code packages.

To install the Red Orchestra SDK, go to your Steam Library window and
click Tools.

Then double-click on **Red Orchestra SDK Beta** to install it.

## Configuring the SDK

By default, this program allows you to modify *[Red
Orchestra](Red_Orchestra "wikilink")*. To set up your SDK to modify
*Darkest Hour* instead,

1.  Right-Click *RedOrchestra SDK Beta* on your Steam *Games* window
    under *Tools* and select *Properties*
2.  Click the *Set launch options...* button on the new window
3.  Type the following in the text line and press *OK*:

`-mod="darkesthour"`

After this is done, you will be able to run this tool configured for
Darkest Hour. If you would like confirmation of the change, browse the
drop down text box in the *Textures* window after the program starts up
and you will see terms like *DH* and *British*, etc.
