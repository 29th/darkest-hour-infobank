## **PIAT and Panzerfaust**

The PIAT and the Panzerfaust are light anti vehicle grenades, do a
moderate amount of damage and are Very difficult to aim at long
distances. There is also [a thread in the Darkest Hour
forums](http://forums.darkesthourgame.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5096) with
more info.

## Basics

The Iron sights above show that the PIAT and Panzerfaust both have 3
different sights to look through each changing the range that you will
shoot (to do this the default key is F while in iron sights)

1.  Is for close range 30m (This is the shot that you would be looking
    for quick and easy kill)
2.  Is for medium range 60m (Requires some practice, but, with time, is
    just as easy as short range shots)
3.  Is for long range 90m (Very rarely would you need to use this. It is
    very difficult to hit your target first shot and takes a lot of
    practice to pull off.)

It is also possible to fairly accurately land shots at longer ranges,
but it requires two steps.

1.  Memorize the view in one of the top sights
2.  Tilt the weapon until that same view is seen through the bottom
    sight.

This can be repeated as often as needed, but accuracy deteriorates
rapidly. Also, the greater the angle the weapon is fired at, the greater
the angle it strikes at. While this can help by striking the relatively
thinner armour on the top of a tank or placing a round over an obstacle,
it becomes more of an all-or-nothing matter.

Essentially, every sight above the first one doubles the
difficulty/halves the accuracy, and intensive practice is definitely
needed to master hitting anything past 60m consistently.

To make matters even more challenging, targets are often on the move, so
your shot has to be aimed at not where the target is now, but where it
will be when your shot lands. This depends on many factors, including
the speed and direction of your target, whether is it moving in a
straight line or not, etc. The only factor you know is the speed of your
shot, and the direction and inclination of your aim. If possible, try to
aim at chokepoints, where there is only one possible place for your
target to go. This will minimize the chance of your shot missing.

## Tactics

The best tactic for these weapons is Guerrilla warfare, ambushing a tank
or a half track gives you a huge advantage over your opponent. Let them
come to you in an environment that holds your opponent to a
disadvantage.

**Tank**

This is very much dependent on where you hit the tank and how much
armour it has the main weak points of a tank is the underside of it as
well as the back of the turret, This is where you lure the tank in to
hilly terrain and wait for the underside to be exposed.

**Half-Tracks**

One hit and it blows up best taken from cover than from plain sight each
work just as well but you never know whose watching. If the driver
realises that you are holding a PIAT or a Panzerfaust he may try for
evasive actions.

**Infantry**

Although these weapons are not specifically suited for this kind of
opponent there blast radius is big enough to kill a grouped enemy.
Generally aiming for the floor in the middle of a group will cause the
most damage, aiming for a direct hit is going to miss nine times out of
ten. Attacking Infantry is best done from cover so if you miss your
first shot you still have time for a second before your likely to be
spotted.

## When and when not to shoot from the hip

Shooting from the hip is risky business and not something you should be
doing all the time, long distance shots are still best done in iron
sight because you have all the time to aim.

The best time to shoot from the hip would be in close range combat, aim
at the floor in your enemyâ€™s general area to maximise your chance of
hitting. Shooting from the hip never guaranties a hit practicing helps
along with a big portion of luck.

## Side Arms

Depending on which Faction you chose you get a different side arm to
use.
