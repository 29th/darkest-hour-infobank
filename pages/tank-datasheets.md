Tank Datasheets were produced by the Red Orchestra team and were found
at their [web
site](http://www.redorchestragame.com/download/p13_sectionid/2). They
provide details on strengths and weaknesses of each tank, including
critical hit points and armour types. Datasheets have not been created
yet for American or British tanks.
